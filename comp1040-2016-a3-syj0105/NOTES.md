When social_network_structure = 0,
according to the proportion of three types of messages, 
all agents' personality is chatty. Among the three types of messages,
RED (recreational) is broadcast by agents accounting for about 30%.
GREEN (gossip)  type of messages are forwarded by agents
at about 15%, and BLUE(business) is forwarded at around 40%.
All regions of the network structure work almost the same.

When social_network_structure = 1,
according to the proportion of three types of messages, 
all agents' personality is chatty. Among the three types of messages,
RED is the most popular message type for agents 
to broadcast accounting for a little more than 50%.
GREEN type of messages are forwarded by agents
at about 20%, and BLUE is forwarded at around 25%.
All regions of the network structure work almost the same.

When social_network_structure = 2,
the GREEN message is the most prevalent and BLUE message is
the least popular type  agents choose to send.
Besides,agents don't talk much often with
specific message.All regions of the network work much the same.

When social_network_structure = 3,
it's not obvious which type message is the most popular.
We can see that agents send message to their friends
randomly.And agents with id 0,2,4 are broadcasting more frequently, 
but relatively the others keep silent more.


When social_network_structure = 4,
the agents with id 0,1,2 broadcast message usually 
while others don't send message so much.
Furthermore, BLUE and RED are more prevalent than GREEN type of 
messages to be broadcast.


When social_network_structure = 5,
the agents of 20 are only forwarded and broadcast,
not specially send a message to some certain friends.
It's more complex than above,an agent may have two more friends.
Agent's personality is randomly assigned,therefore,
it's hard to say what characteristic this network 
has for status varies from time to time.

All in all, agents who have more friends would send more messages.
Agents with CHATTY personality are tend to send more 
recreational and business types of messages.
